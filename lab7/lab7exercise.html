              <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

                    To maintain an HVAC system, regularly check and replace air filters, clean the coils, inspect the ductwork for leaks,
                    ensure proper insulation, and schedule professional maintenance at least once a year. 
                    Additionally, monitor the thermostat settings and keep the outdoor unit clear of debris. Regular maintenance helps.

                    It is generally recommended to change your HVAC air filter every 1 to 3 months, depending on factors such as the type of filter,
                    the level of dust and allergens in your home, and whether you have pets. Regularly checking the filter and replacing it when
                    it appears dirty can help maintain optimal airflow and indoor air quality.
